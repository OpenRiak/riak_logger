# Riak Kernel Logger Support
This repository contains configuration and operational support elements for logging with the
[OTP Kernel Logger](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/kernel/logger_chapter).

## Configuration
Sample configuration using this application's features can be found in the
[`logger.config`](priv/logger.config) file.
## Filters
Filters are defined in the [`riak_logger`](src/riak_logger.erl) module.

Filter documentation can be generated with the `rebar3 edoc` command.
## Bugs
What??? No way ...

Yeah, you should probably file an issue.
